      <h1>Functional Programming</h1>
      <p>The focus of this course is on practical functional programming.  That means that, by the end, you should be able to write programs in a <a href="#functional-style">functional <em>style</em></a> and in a <span title="A language which makes it easy to program in a functional <em>style</em>.">functional <em>language</em></span>.</p>

      <p>You can do functional programming in many <span title="C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, ...">modern languages</span>.  However, to learn functional programming, it is worthwhile to use a language which emphasises a functional-first approach; otherwise, it will be very easy to fall into bad old non-functional habits.  We will be using F#, a multi-paradigm language with a functional-first emphasis.</p>

      <p>In functional programming, we use <a href="#functions-part-1">functions</a> to create and transform <a href="#data">data</a>.</p>
   </div>

   <div id="functional-style" class="step txt">
      <img style="height:4em;float:left" src="https://openclipart.org/people/jeeeyul/gangnam-style.svg" />
      <h1>Functional style</h1>
      <p>A functional style of programming is characterised by</p>
      <ul>
         <li><em>Immutability</em>: values, once created, can never be modified.  In other words, data is not <em>mutable</em>.</li>
         <li><em>First-class functions</em>: you can call and define <a href="#functions-part-1">functions</a> as usual, and you can also do anything with a function that you would be able to do with a value.  For example,
            <ul>
               <li>You can give a value a name (we usually call this a <em>variable</em>), and you can give a function a name</li>
               <li>You can pass a value around as a parameter, and you can pass a function around as a parameter</li>
               <li>You can store a value in a list or other data structure, and you can store a function in a list or other data structure</li>
               <li>You can give more than one name to a value (this is called <em>aliasing</em>), and you can give more than one name to a function</li>
               <li>You can return a value from a function, and you can return a function from a function</li>
               <li>Every value has a <a href="#types">type</a>, and every function has a type.</li>
               <li>You can create literal values (i.e. values not associated with any variable name), and you can create literal functions (these are called <em>lambda functions</em>)</li>
               <li>You can create a value at runtime based on user input, and you can create a function at runtime based on user input</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...and much, much more!  If in doubt, ask yourself whether you would be able to do a particular thing with a value.  If the answer is <q>yes</q>, then you are probably able to do the same thing with a function.</p>
         </li>
         <li><em>Purity</em>: a pure function has no side-effects and does not depend on anything except its input.
            <ul>
               <li>A <em>side-effect</em> is anything that a function does <em>above and beyond</em> returning a value.  For example, writing to a database, printing something to the screen, or altering an object's state are all side-effects.</li>
               <li>An external dependency might involve reading the system clock, using a random number generator, or reading data from the network.</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It seems obvious that first-class functions are better than the <q>conventional</q> methods and functions that you've seen so far in your Computer Science courses.  First-class functions can do everything that <q>ordinary</q> functions can do, and more &mdash; they're like <span title="Not to be taken as an endorsement of steroid use.  If you want medical advice, go and see a doctor, not a Computer Scientist.">functions on steroids</span>.  But what about <em>purity</em> and <em>immutability</em>?  <a href="#fp-benefits">Why are those useful?</a></p>

    <div id="functions-part-1" class="step txt">
		<h1>Functions, Part I</h1>
      <p>A function is something that takes <em>one</em> input and produces <em>one</em> output.  Another way of phrasing the same thing is: a function is something which, when given an input, will produce an output.</p>
      <p>We'll talk about F# functions later on.  For now, let's consider an abstract function which, when given an integer <code>n</code>, will give back <code>n+5</code>.  In C#, you might have written</p>
      <pre><code>
         int AddFive(int n) {
            return n + 5;
         }
      </code></pre>
      <p>So, if I give <code>8</code> as an input, I'll get back <code>13</code> as the output.  We can write down the essentials of this abstract function as:</p>
      <pre><code>
         n -&gt; n + 5
      </code></pre>
      <p>On the left side of the <code>-&gt;</code>, we have the <em>input</em>.  On the right side, we have the <em>output</em>.</p>
      <p>Now, a function is nice, but it does me no good to just have a function sitting around and doing nothing.  I'd like to <em>apply</em> it (in Computer Science, we'd say that I want to <em>call</em> the function), and to do that I must give it an input.  To give this function an input, I'll enclose the function in parentheses, and give it the input just after the parentheses, separated by a space:
      <pre><code>
         (n -&gt; n + 5) 8
      </code></pre>
      <p>Remember: when a function is given an input, it provides its output.  So the above expression is semantically equivalent to this:
      <pre><code>
         13
      </code></pre>
      <p>Make sure that you see how this works &mdash; and, especially, make sure that you understand the definition of a <em>function</em>.  Also pay attention to the notation I've been using for an abstract function.  You'll see me using the same notation later on.</p>
      <p>When you're ready to move on, let's take a look at what <a href="#functions-part-2">a real function looks like in F#</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="functions-part-2" class="step txt">
      <h1>Functions, Part II</h1>
      <p>In F#, here's how you would write down the abstract <code>n -&gt; n + 5</code> function:</p>
      <pre><code>
         fun n -&gt; n + 5
      </code></pre>
      <p>(Almost the same as the abstract notation, isn't it?)  And here's how you would <em>apply</em> (<span title="I'll use both terms interchangeably">or <em>call</em></span>) a function:</p>
      <pre><code>
         (fun n -&gt; n + 5) 8
      </code></pre>
      <p>...giving you the result</p>
      <pre><code>
         13
      </code></pre>
      <p>But don't take my word for it.  Try it out.  Here's a F# console:</p>
      <div style="min-height:5em;background:black;border-radius:7px;color:green;padding:1ex;font-family:'Nunito';position:relative"># (fun n -&gt; n+5) 8
      <div style="padding-left:5px;padding-right:5px;border-radius:7px;position:absolute;bottom:2px;right:2px;background:grey;color:black">run</div>
      </div>
      <p>Click inside the console to activate it, then type in <code>(fun n -&gt; n+5) 8</code> and click on <q><span title="It's the button at the bottom-right of the console">run</span></q>.  See what the result is.  Notice that the <a href="#types">type</a> of the result (i.e. <code>int</code>) is displayed along with the answer.</p>
      <p>Then type in <code>fun n -&gt; n+5</code> and click on <q>run</q>.  You'll get an interesting result as your output.  Remember: everything in F# is <a href="#types">typed</a>, and that includes functions.</p>
    </div>

   <div id="data" class="step txt">
      <h1>Types and data</h1>
      <p>In F#, everything has a type.  You're already familiar with some of these types (<code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>bool</code>, and <code>char</code>, for example).  Unlike in C# or Java, types are usually <a href="#type-inference">inferred</a>, so you (usually!) don't have to specify the type of anything explicitly.  Above and beyond the usual basic types, there is also the <a href="#unit-type">unit</a> type that you need to know about.</p>
      <p>A class in C# is a <em>composite</em> type: it is a type which contains other types.  F# supports <span title="...including objects, but we won't be using objects in this module at all">a wide variety of composite types</span> which are useful in a variety of situations.  Each type has <a href="#defined-created-decomposed">a way of being defined, a way of being created, and ways of being decomposed</a>.</p>
      <ul>
         <li>To represent a group of data where each element has the <em>same</em> type, you would use a <a href="#lists">list</a>.  Example use-case: representing the names of every member of the class.  (You could also use an array, and F# supports arrays natively; but lists are a more functional data structure, so we'll be using them instead).</li>
         <li>To represent a group of data where elements have <em>different</em> types, you would use a <a href="#tuples">tuple</a> or a <a href="#records">record</a>.  Example use-case: representing the name, height, and weight of every member of the class.</li>
         <li>To represent a data which must be one of a limited set of known categories, you would use a <a href="#discriminated-unions">discriminated union</a>.  Example use-case: representing an atomic particle as <span title="It is impossible for an atomic particle to be anything except for one of these, and an atomic particle cannot be more than one of these."><em>one of</em> Electron, Neutron, or Proton</span>.
      </ul>
      <p>It is possible, easy, and idiomatic to mix data types.  For example, one may have a list of discriminated unions, each of which has a tuple or record associated with it.</p>
   </div>

   <div id="defined-created-decomposed" class="step txt">
      <h1>Definition, Creation, and Decomposition</h1>
      <p>It sounds complicated to say that every composite type has a way of being defined, created, and decomposed &hellip; but it's not complicated.  In fact, you already know how to do it, and you've been doing it for years in a non-functional language.  If you don't believe me, read on, and you'll see that it's true!</p>
      <p>Let's use C# as our language, and a class as our composite type.  We'll start with an empty class.</p>
      <pre><code>
         class Wtf {
         }
      </code></pre>
      <p>Now, you want to add an <code>int</code> property to this class &mdash; in other words, you want to <em>define</em> some of the data that makes up the composite type.  So, you write</p>
      <pre><code>
         class Wtf {
            public int Ftw { get; set; }
         }
      </code></pre>
      <p>When you want to <em>create</em> an instance of the class, you write</p>
      <pre><code>
         Wtf v = new Wtf();
      </code></pre>
      <p>And when you want to get the value of the <code>int</code> from inside the object &mdash; in other words, you want to <em>decompose</em> the object to get at the actual data inside it &mdash; you would write</p>
      <pre><code>
         int whatever = v.Ftw;
      </code></pre>
      <p>Take a look at the code above.  It's not unfamiliar or complex; by now, you should have created and used hundreds of classes in your own projects.  Can you see that you write completely different code to <em>define</em>, <em>create</em>, and <em>decompose</em> a composite type in C#?  In <span title="C, Python, Java, JavaScript, ...">other languages</span> that you've used, you'll notice exactly the same definition, creation, and decomposition of data types.</p>
      <p>Definition, creation, and decomposition are all interrelated.  After all, you cannot create something that you haven't defined; you can't decompose what hasn't been defined or created; and there's no point in defining or creating unless you can decompose to get the data out.</p>
      <p>The same applies to types in F#.  Each type has a way in which it is defined; a way in which it is created; and ways in which it is decomposed.  Once you learn how to define, create, and decompose a type, you will be able to use a type.</p>
